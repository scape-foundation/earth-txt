# TXT Files

Several similar text standards already exist for specification of various aspects of a website. Examples include:


---


## robots.txt

`robots.txt` contains information and instructions for robots (so it should be read/used by web crawlers, spiders and other types of bots).

## licence.txt

`licence.txt` is simply a generic name for any license file. There is no web "standard" or convention for "license.txt" files like there is for, say, robots.txt or humans.txt. However, many web "applications" (those written in scripting languages, for example) will use a "license.txt" file to convey the terms under which the application is distributed (common to open source projects especially). This file often resides in the root of an application directory.
