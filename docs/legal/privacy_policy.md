Stichting Scape Foundatino will collect certain non-personally identify information 
about you as you use our sites. We may use this data to better understand our 
users. We can also publish this data, but the data will be about a large group 
of users, not individuals.

We will also ask you to provide personal information, but you'll always be able 
to opt out. If you give us personal information, we won't do anything evil with
it.

We can also use cookies, but you can choose not to store these.

That's the basic idea, but you must read through the entire Privacy Policy
below and agree with all the details before you use any of our sites.

Stichting Scape Foundatino ("Scape Foundation") makes available services such as

## Visitors
Like most website operators, Stichting Scape Foundatino collects 
non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and 
servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language 
preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. 
Stichting Scape Foundatino's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying 
information is to better understand how Stichting Scape Foundatino's visitors 
use its website. From time to time, Stichting Scape Foundatino may release 
non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a 
report on trends in the usage of its website.

Stichting Scape Foundatino also collects potentially personally-identifying 
information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Stichting Scape Foundatino does 
not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not 
disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses 
and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may 
also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of 
Service.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Stichting Scape Foundatino's websites choose to interact with 
Stichting Scape Foundatino in ways that require Stichting Scape Foundatino to gather 
personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that 
Stichting Scape Foundatino gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. 
Stichting Scape Foundatino collects such information only insofar as is necessary 
or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with 
Stichting Scape Foundatino. Stichting Scape Foundatino does not disclose 
personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors 
can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat 
that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.

Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for 
optional personal information. For instance, when posting a comment, may 
provide a website that will be displayed along with a user's name when the 
comment is displayed. Supplying such personal information is completely 
optional and is only displayed for the benefit and the convenience of the user.

## Aggregated Statistics
Stichting Scape Foundatino may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to 
the Service. For instance, Stichting Scape Foundatino may monitor the most popular 
parts of the URL of its sites and services. Stichting Scape Foundatino may display 
this information publicly or provide it to others. However, 
Stichting Scape Foundatino does not disclose personally-identifying information 
other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Stichting Scape Foundatino discloses potentially personally-identifying and 
personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors 
and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to 
process it on Stichting Scape Foundatino's behalf or to provide services available 
at Stichting Scape Foundatino's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose 
it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations 
may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent 
to the transfer of such information to them. Stichting Scape Foundatino will not 
rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying 
information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated 
organizations, as described above, Stichting Scape Foundatino discloses potentially 
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when 
required to do so by law, or when Stichting Scape Foundatino believes in good faith 
that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of 
Stichting Scape Foundatino, third parties or the public at large. If you are a 
registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, 
Stichting Scape Foundatino may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new 
features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going 
on with Stichting Scape Foundatino and our products. We primarily use our website 
and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this 
type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support 
email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it 
in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support 
other users. Stichting Scape Foundatino takes all measures reasonably necessary to 
protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of 
potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

Stichting Scape Foundatino identify and track visitors, their usage of 
Stichting Scape Foundatino Service, and their Service access preferences. 
Stichting Scape Foundatino visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their 
computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
