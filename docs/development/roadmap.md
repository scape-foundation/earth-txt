# Roadmap

This roadmap provides an overview of the direction this project is heading.


Underlying questions:

- What aspects play the largest role in the environmental effects of the Internet?
- How can these effects be determined quantitatively and qualitatively in a simple way?
- What secondary tools need to be developed to make the determination of these effects widely accessible?
- How can this then be described in an unambiguous and standardized way?
- What steps are needed for officially accepted standardization?
- How do we ensure that as many websites as possible adopt the standard?


Future actions following project:

- A publicly accessible GitHub repository will be set up for the standard.
- Applications will be made for funds to further develop the standard.
- It is our intention to get the standard accepted as an official standard by IANA.
- A website is being developed for the standard on the domain earthtxt.org.
- Large technology companies and governments are being lobbied to adopt the standard.
