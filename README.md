# earth.txt


**A .TXT file for Earth.**\
Earth.txt is a proposed standard which allows websites to define environmental sustainability policies.


## Quick Start


### 1. Create


Create a text file called `earth.txt` (always in lower-case) and make it UTF-8 encoded to avoid issues with special characters and multiple languages.



### 2. Place

In principle, the earth.txt file should be placed under the `/.well-known/` path of your website. For example:

`https://example.com/.well-known/earth.txt`


If the `/.well-known/` directory cannot be used for technical reasons, or if you want to use a fallback option, the `earth.txt` file can also be placed in the `root` directory. For example:

`https://example.com/earth.txt`


Optionally, you can add a `‚Äúhelp‚Äù` tag to the `<head>` section of the site:

`<link type="text/plain" rel="help" href="https://example.com/earth.txt"/>`

### 3. Serve
